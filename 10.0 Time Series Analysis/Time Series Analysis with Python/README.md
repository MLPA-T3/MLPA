Sample Timeseries Data Plots

**What is Time Series Data?**

Time series data is a sequence of data points collected or recorded at specific time intervals. Examples include daily stock prices, monthly sales figures, yearly climate data, and many more. The primary characteristic of time series data is its temporal order, meaning the sequence in which the data points are recorded matters.

**Unique Characteristics of Time Series Data**

Time series data has several unique characteristics that distinguish it from other types of data:

1.  **Trend**: This is the long-term movement or direction in the data. For example, the general increase in a company’s sales over several years.
2.  **Seasonality**: These are patterns that repeat at regular intervals, such as higher ice cream sales during the summer.
3.  **Cyclic Patterns**: Unlike seasonality, cyclic patterns are not of a fixed period. These could be influenced by economic cycles or other factors.
4.  **Irregular Components**: These are random or unpredictable variations in the data.

**Types of Time Series Data**

**Univariate vs. Multivariate Time Series**:

-   **Univariate**: A single variable or feature recorded over time (e.g., daily temperature).
-   **Multivariate**: Multiple variables recorded over time (e.g., daily temperature, humidity, and wind speed).

**Regular vs. Irregular Time Series**:

-   **Regular**: Data points are recorded at consistent time intervals (e.g., hourly, daily).
-   **Irregular**: Data points are recorded at inconsistent time intervals.

**Python Code Example**

Let’s create a simple time series dataset using Python to illustrate these concepts.

```
<span id="311a" data-selectable-paragraph=""><span>import</span> pandas <span>as</span> pd<br><span>import</span> numpy <span>as</span> np<br><br># Creating a sample time series <span>data</span><br>date_range = pd.date_range(start=<span>'1/1/2020'</span>, periods=<span>100</span>, freq=<span>'D'</span>)<br><span>data</span> = np.random.randn(<span>100</span>)<br>time_series = pd.Series(<span>data</span>, index=date_range)<br><br>print(time_series.head())</span>
```

This code snippet creates a univariate time series data with 100 daily records starting from January 1, 2020.

> Understanding the basic characteristics and types of time series data is crucial because it helps in selecting the right analysis techniques and models. Recognizing patterns such as trends and seasonality can significantly improve forecasting accuracy.

## Preprocessing Time Series Data

Before diving into the analysis and forecasting, it’s essential to preprocess your time series data to ensure accuracy and reliability. This section will cover how to handle missing values, outliers, and transform your data for better analysis.

Timeseries Data Plots

**Data Collection and Cleaning**

Time series data often comes from various sources such as databases, APIs, or CSV files. The first step is to load your data into a suitable format, usually a Pandas DataFrame.

**Handling Missing Values and Outliers**

Missing values and outliers can significantly affect your analysis. Here are common methods to handle them:

1.  **Filling Missing Values**: Use methods like forward fill, backward fill, or interpolation.
2.  **Removing Outliers**: Detect and remove outliers using statistical methods like Z-score or IQR (Interquartile Range).

**Python Code Example**

```
<span id="78ce" data-selectable-paragraph=""><br>time_series_with_nan = time_series.copy()<br>time_series_with_nan[::<span>10</span>] = np.nan  <br><br><br>time_series_filled = time_series_with_nan.fillna(method=<span>'ffill'</span>)<br><br><br><span>from</span> scipy.stats <span>import</span> zscore<br>z_scores = zscore(time_series_filled)<br>abs_z_scores = np.<span>abs</span>(z_scores)<br>filtered_entries = (abs_z_scores &lt; <span>3</span>)  <br>time_series_no_outliers = time_series_filled[filtered_entries]</span>
```

**Data Transformation**

Transforming your data can help in identifying patterns and making it ready for analysis. Common transformations include:

1.  **Smoothing**: Techniques like moving average can help in reducing noise.
2.  **Differencing**: Used to remove trends and seasonality.
3.  **Scaling and Normalization**: Ensure your data fits within a specific range for better model performance.

**Python Code Example**

```
<span id="4bb5" data-selectable-paragraph=""><br>moving_avg = time_series_no_outliers.rolling(window=5).mean()<br><br><br>differenced_series = time_series_no_outliers.diff().dropna()<br><br><br>from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler<br>scaler = StandardScaler()<br>scaled_series = scaler.fit_transform(time_series_no_outliers.values.reshape(-1, 1))</span>
```

> Preprocessing is a crucial step that ensures your data is clean and well-prepared for analysis. Proper handling of missing values and outliers, along with necessary transformations, can significantly enhance the accuracy of your forecasts.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

In this section, we’ll explore various techniques to understand and visualize your time series data. EDA helps uncover patterns, trends, and relationships that can inform your forecasting models.

EDA With Timeseries Dataset

**Visualization Techniques**

Visualizing your time series data is crucial to grasp its underlying patterns and characteristics. Here are some essential visualization techniques:

1.  **Line Plots**: The most straightforward way to visualize time series data.
2.  **Seasonal Plots**: To identify seasonal patterns.
3.  **Autocorrelation Plots**: To check the correlation of the series with its past values.

**Python Code Example**

Let’s use Python to create these visualizations.

```
<span id="7f4c" data-selectable-paragraph=""><span>import</span> pandas <span>as</span> pd<br><span>import</span> numpy <span>as</span> np<br><span>import</span> matplotlib.pyplot <span>as</span> plt<br><span>from</span> statsmodels.graphics.tsaplots <span>import</span> plot_acf, plot_pacf<br><br><br>np.random.seed(<span>0</span>)<br>date_range = pd.date_range(start=<span>'1/1/2010'</span>, periods=<span>120</span>, freq=<span>'M'</span>)<br>trend = np.linspace(<span>50</span>, <span>150</span>, <span>120</span>)  <br>seasonality = <span>10</span> + <span>20</span> * np.sin(np.linspace(<span>0</span>, <span>3.14</span> * <span>2</span>, <span>120</span>))  <br>noise = np.random.normal(scale=<span>10</span>, size=<span>120</span>)  <br>data = trend + seasonality + noise<br>time_series = pd.Series(data, index=date_range)<br><br><br>time_series[::<span>15</span>] = np.nan<br>time_series = time_series.fillna(method=<span>'ffill'</span>)<br><br><br>moving_avg = time_series.rolling(window=<span>12</span>).mean()<br><br><br>differenced_series = time_series.diff().dropna()<br><br><br>time_series_monthly = time_series.resample(<span>'M'</span>).mean()<br><br><br>plt.figure(figsize=(<span>15</span>, <span>18</span>))<br><br><br>plt.subplot(<span>4</span>, <span>1</span>, <span>1</span>)<br>plt.plot(time_series, label=<span>'Original Time Series'</span>, color=<span>'blue'</span>)<br>plt.title(<span>'Time Series Line Plot'</span>)<br>plt.xlabel(<span>'Date'</span>)<br>plt.ylabel(<span>'Sales'</span>)<br>plt.legend()<br>plt.grid(<span>True</span>)<br><br><br>plt.subplot(<span>4</span>, <span>1</span>, <span>2</span>)<br>plt.plot(time_series_monthly, label=<span>'Monthly Averaged Time Series'</span>, color=<span>'green'</span>)<br>plt.title(<span>'Seasonal Plot'</span>)<br>plt.xlabel(<span>'Date'</span>)<br>plt.ylabel(<span>'Monthly Average Sales'</span>)<br>plt.legend()<br>plt.grid(<span>True</span>)<br><br><br>plt.subplot(<span>4</span>, <span>1</span>, <span>3</span>)<br>cleaned_time_series = time_series.dropna()<br>plot_acf(cleaned_time_series, lags=<span>20</span>, ax=plt.gca())<br>plt.title(<span>'Autocorrelation Plot'</span>)<br>plt.grid(<span>True</span>)<br><br><br>plt.subplot(<span>4</span>, <span>1</span>, <span>4</span>)<br>plot_pacf(cleaned_time_series, lags=<span>20</span>, ax=plt.gca())<br>plt.title(<span>'Partial Autocorrelation Plot'</span>)<br>plt.grid(<span>True</span>)<br><br>plt.tight_layout()<br>plt.savefig(<span>'./eda_visuals.png'</span>)<br>plt.show()</span>
```

EDA provides insights into the structure and characteristics of your time series data. For example:

-   **Line Plots**: Help identify overall trends and any apparent seasonality.
-   **Seasonal Plots**: Highlight repeating patterns at regular intervals.
-   **Autocorrelation and Partial Autocorrelation Plots**: Show the relationship between current and past values of the series, indicating potential lags to include in models.

## Time Series Decomposition

Time series decomposition is a crucial step in understanding the underlying components of your data. By breaking down a time series into its constituent parts, you can gain insights into the trend, seasonality, and residual (irregular) components. This process helps in better understanding and forecasting the data.

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:816/1*GKeDg0KYoSnZ5sAmggsUhQ.png)

**Decomposition Techniques**

**Decomposition Techniques**

There are two main models for decomposing a time series: additive and multiplicative.

**1\. Additive Model**: This model assumes that the components add together to produce the time series:

```
<span id="54ac" data-selectable-paragraph="">Y<span>(</span>t<span>)</span><span>=</span><span>T</span><span>(</span>t<span>)</span><span>+</span>S<span>(</span>t<span>)</span><span>+</span>R<span>(</span>t<span>)</span>Y<span>(</span>t<span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>T</span><span>(</span>t<span>)</span> <span>+</span> S<span>(</span>t<span>)</span> <span>+</span> R<span>(</span>t<span>)</span>Y<span>(</span>t<span>)</span><span>=</span><span>T</span><span>(</span>t<span>)</span><span>+</span>S<span>(</span>t<span>)</span><span>+</span>R<span>(</span>t<span>)</span></span>
```

where Y(t)Y(t)Y(t) is the observed time series, T(t)T(t)T(t) is the trend component, S(t)S(t)S(t) is the seasonal component, and R(t)R(t)R(t) is the residual component.

**2\. Multiplicative Model**: This model assumes that the components multiply together to produce the time series:

```
<span id="d63e" data-selectable-paragraph="">Y<span>(</span>t<span>)</span><span>=</span><span>T</span><span>(</span>t<span>)</span>×S<span>(</span>t<span>)</span>×R<span>(</span>t<span>)</span>Y<span>(</span>t<span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>T</span><span>(</span>t<span>)</span> <span>\</span>times S<span>(</span>t<span>)</span> <span>\</span>times R<span>(</span>t<span>)</span>Y<span>(</span>t<span>)</span><span>=</span><span>T</span><span>(</span>t<span>)</span>×S<span>(</span>t<span>)</span>×R<span>(</span>t<span>)</span></span>
```

The multiplicative model is useful when the seasonal variations are proportional to the level of the trend.

**Using Python to Decompose Time Series**

Let’s decompose the time series using Python’s `statsmodels` library. We'll use the realistic dummy dataset we created earlier.

**Python Code Example**

```
<span id="c888" data-selectable-paragraph=""><span>import</span> pandas <span>as</span> pd<br><span>import</span> numpy <span>as</span> np<br><span>import</span> matplotlib.pyplot <span>as</span> plt<br><span>from</span> statsmodels.tsa.seasonal <span>import</span> seasonal_decompose<br><br><br>np.random.seed(<span>0</span>)<br>date_range = pd.date_range(start=<span>'1/1/2010'</span>, periods=<span>120</span>, freq=<span>'M'</span>)<br>trend = np.linspace(<span>50</span>, <span>150</span>, <span>120</span>)  <br>seasonality = <span>10</span> + <span>20</span> * np.sin(np.linspace(<span>0</span>, <span>3.14</span> * <span>2</span>, <span>120</span>))  <br>noise = np.random.normal(scale=<span>10</span>, size=<span>120</span>)  <br>data = trend + seasonality + noise<br>time_series = pd.Series(data, index=date_range)<br><br><br>time_series[::<span>15</span>] = np.nan<br>time_series = time_series.fillna(method=<span>'ffill'</span>)  <br><br><br>time_series = time_series.dropna()<br><br><br>decomposition = seasonal_decompose(time_series, model=<span>'additive'</span>)<br>trend = decomposition.trend<br>seasonal = decomposition.seasonal<br>residual = decomposition.resid<br><br><br>plt.figure(figsize=(<span>15</span>, <span>12</span>))<br><br>plt.subplot(<span>4</span>, <span>1</span>, <span>1</span>)<br>plt.plot(time_series, label=<span>'Original Time Series'</span>, color=<span>'blue'</span>)<br>plt.title(<span>'Original Time Series'</span>)<br>plt.legend()<br><br>plt.subplot(<span>4</span>, <span>1</span>, <span>2</span>)<br>plt.plot(trend, label=<span>'Trend Component'</span>, color=<span>'orange'</span>)<br>plt.title(<span>'Trend Component'</span>)<br>plt.legend()<br><br>plt.subplot(<span>4</span>, <span>1</span>, <span>3</span>)<br>plt.plot(seasonal, label=<span>'Seasonal Component'</span>, color=<span>'green'</span>)<br>plt.title(<span>'Seasonal Component'</span>)<br>plt.legend()<br><br>plt.subplot(<span>4</span>, <span>1</span>, <span>4</span>)<br>plt.plot(residual, label=<span>'Residual Component'</span>, color=<span>'red'</span>)<br>plt.title(<span>'Residual Component'</span>)<br>plt.legend()<br><br><br>plt.tight_layout()<br>plt.savefig(<span>'/visuals/time_series_decomposition.png'</span>)<br>plt.show()</span>
```

Decomposing the time series helps in identifying:

-   **Trend**: The long-term progression of the series.
-   **Seasonality**: The repeating short-term cycle in the series.
-   **Residuals**: The remaining noise after removing the trend and seasonality.

These components can be analyzed separately to better understand the behavior of the time series and to improve forecasting models.

## Time Series Forecasting Methods

Forecasting is the process of making predictions about future values based on historical time series data. There are various methods to achieve this, ranging from simple statistical models to advanced machine learning techniques. In this section, we’ll explore some of the most commonly used forecasting methods.

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:816/1*zBjs0oKCWzFD37s_3zvD4A.png)

Time Series Forecasting

**Classical Methods**

1.  Moving Average (MA)
2.  Autoregressive (AR) Models
3.  Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA)

**Advanced Methods**

1.  Seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA)
2.  Exponential Smoothing State Space Model (ETS)

**Machine Learning Approaches**

1.  Linear Regression
2.  Decision Trees and Random Forests
3.  Support Vector Machines
4.  Neural Networks (RNN, LSTM)

Let’s focus on ARIMA and SARIMA models for this section, as they are widely used and relatively straightforward to implement with Python.

**Using Python for Time Series Forecasting**

We’ll use the `statsmodels` library to demonstrate how to fit ARIMA and SARIMA models to our time series data.

**Python Code Example**

```

```

Please note that:

1.  **ARIMA Model**: Suitable for non-seasonal data, ARIMA can model the autocorrelations in the data.
2.  **SARIMA Model**: Extends ARIMA to handle seasonality, making it ideal for data with seasonal patterns.

## Model Evaluation and Selection

Selecting the best forecasting model is crucial for making accurate predictions. In this section, we’ll explore various techniques and metrics for evaluating time series models and selecting the most suitable one.

**Evaluation Metrics**

**1\. Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: Measures the average magnitude of the errors in a set of predictions, without considering their direction.

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:450/1*18P-UcpFhyzNhyyMOcjxqQ.png)

2\. **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Measures the average of the squares of the errors, giving more weight to larger errors.

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:364/1*-lwGgIHLQ-ANU857VOUAPQ.png)

**3\. Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: The square root of the mean squared error.

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:310/1*NWaih5OPg8G3To2YLARkTA.png)

4\. **Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)**: Measures the average absolute percentage error.

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:387/1*o55fh_PlaIOlvJ6LookJbA.png)

**Cross-Validation Techniques**

1.  **Rolling Forecast Origin**: A method where the model is re-estimated for each prediction point, and the forecast is made for the next time step.
2.  **Time Series Split**: Splitting the time series data into training and testing sets based on time.

**Model Diagnostics**

1.  **Residual Analysis**: Check if the residuals (errors) from the model are white noise (i.e., they should be uncorrelated and normally distributed with a mean of zero).
2.  **Autocorrelation of Residuals**: Use autocorrelation plots to check for patterns in the residuals.

Let’s evaluate the ARIMA and SARIMA models we fitted in the previous section.

Residual plots

**Note That:**

The visual above shows the residuals from the ARIMA and SARIMA models. The evaluation metrics are as follows:

**ARIMA**:

-   MAE: 6.74
-   MSE: 86.06
-   RMSE: 9.28
-   MAPE: NaN (due to division by zero or very small actual values)

**SARIMA**:

-   MAE: 11.68
-   MSE: 195.52
-   RMSE: 13.98
-   MAPE: NaN (due to division by zero or very small actual values)

The residual plots indicate how well the models fit the data, with the goal being that the residuals should ideally resemble white noise.

1.  **Evaluation Metrics**: Provide a quantitative measure of the model’s performance.
2.  **Residual Analysis**: Helps in diagnosing issues with the model and ensuring that the residuals are uncorrelated and normally distributed.

## Best Practices and Common Pitfalls

In this final section, we’ll discuss some best practices to follow when performing time series analysis and forecasting, as well as common pitfalls to avoid.

**Best Practices**

1.  **Understand Your Data**: Before diving into analysis, take the time to understand the nature of your time series data. Recognize patterns such as trends, seasonality, and cycles.
2.  **Proper Preprocessing**: Always clean your data to handle missing values and outliers. Ensure your data is stationary if required by the model you choose.
3.  **Model Selection**: Choose the right model based on the characteristics of your data. Use simpler models like ARIMA for non-seasonal data and SARIMA for seasonal data.
4.  **Cross-Validation**: Use cross-validation techniques to evaluate the performance of your models. Rolling forecast origin and time series split are common methods.
5.  **Residual Analysis**: After fitting your model, analyze the residuals to ensure they are white noise. This indicates that the model has captured all the underlying patterns in the data.
6.  **Regular Updates**: Time series data can change over time, so it’s crucial to regularly update your models with new data to maintain their accuracy.
7.  **Automate Where Possible**: Use automated tools and scripts to streamline your workflow, especially for data preprocessing and model evaluation.

**Common Pitfalls**

1.  **Overfitting**: Creating a model that is too complex can lead to overfitting, where the model performs well on the training data but poorly on new data. Use simpler models and regularization techniques to avoid this.
2.  **Ignoring Seasonality**: Failing to account for seasonal patterns can lead to inaccurate forecasts. Always check for seasonality in your data and use appropriate models like SARIMA if necessary.
3.  **Neglecting Model Diagnostics**: Skipping residual analysis and other diagnostics can lead to misleading results. Always perform thorough diagnostics to validate your model.
4.  **Using Inappropriate Metrics**: Different metrics provide different insights. Using only one metric can give an incomplete picture of model performance. Use multiple evaluation metrics like MAE, MSE, RMSE, and MAPE.
5.  **Data Leakage**: Ensure that future data does not influence the model training. This can lead to over-optimistic performance estimates. Properly split your data into training and test sets.
6.  **Static Models for Dynamic Data**: Static models can become obsolete as new data becomes available. Regularly update your models to adapt to new trends and patterns.

> By following these best practices and avoiding common pitfalls, you can improve the accuracy and reliability of your time series forecasts. Remember, the key to successful time series analysis is a thorough understanding of your data and a disciplined approach to model building and evaluation.
